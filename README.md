# TEA-ECB-and-TEA-CBC-Encryption-Decryption-Program

## Overview

This program implements the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) for encrypting and decrypting images using ECB (Electronic Codebook) and CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) modes. The images are processed in grayscale, and the encrypted and decrypted results are saved and displayed.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- `Pillow` library for image processing
- `NumPy` library for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` library for plotting
- `termcolor` library for colored terminal output

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pillow numpy matplotlib termcolor
