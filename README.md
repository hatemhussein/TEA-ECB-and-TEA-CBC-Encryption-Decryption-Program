# TEA-ECB-and-TEA-CBC-Encryption-Decryption-Program

## Overview

This program implements the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) for encrypting and decrypting images using ECB (Electronic Codebook) and CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) modes. The images are processed in grayscale, and the encrypted and decrypted results are saved and displayed.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- `Pillow` library for image processing
- `NumPy` library for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` library for plotting
- `termcolor` library for colored terminal output

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pillow numpy matplotlib termcolor
```


## Files

The project consists of the following files:
- main.py: The main script that runs the TEA encryption/decryption program.

## Usage

Steps to Run the Program:
- Directly clone the repo from my github:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/hatemhussein/TEA-ECB-and-TEA-CBC-Encryption-Decryption-Program.git
- You can manually run the program by Open PyCharm and create a new project or open an existing project.
- Add main.py Script: Add the main.py script provided above to your project.
- Run the Script: Right-click on the main.py file in the Project Explorer and select "Run 'main'".
- Follow the Prompts: The program will prompt you to enter the path of the original image, key, IV, and paths to save the encrypted and decrypted images. Follow the instructions and provide the required inputs.
